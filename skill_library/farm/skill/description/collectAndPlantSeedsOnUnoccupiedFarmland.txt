async function collectAndPlantSeedsOnUnoccupiedFarmland(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting wheat seeds from a chest and planting them on unoccupied farmland. First, it finds a chest and checks if it exists. If not, it returns. Then, it collects 10 wheat seeds from the chest and notifies that the seeds are collected. Next, it finds 20 unoccupied farmland blocks within a certain distance. If there are less than 10 unoccupied farmland blocks, it returns. After that, it equips the wheat seeds in the hand. It then iterates through the first 10 unoccupied farmland blocks and goes to each block, looks at it, and plants the seeds.
