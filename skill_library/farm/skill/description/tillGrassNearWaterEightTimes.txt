async function tillGrassNearWaterEightTimes(bot) {
    // The function is about tilling grass blocks near a water source using a hoe. It first checks if the bot has a hoe in its inventory, and if not, it collects one from a chest. Then, it finds a water source and moves to a block next to it. After that, it finds a nearby grass block on the same level as the bot and moves to a block next to it. The bot equips the hoe, looks at the grass block, and uses the hoe to till the grass block. This process is repeated eight times in the `tillGrassNearWaterEightTimes` function.
