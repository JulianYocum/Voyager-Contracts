    "description": "There is a river that has been polluted with waste (wet sponges). Nearby there are several red mushroom blocks. Harvesting a mushroom block yields 1-2 red mushrooms, worth 3 emeralds each. However, mushroom blocks only regrow if the number of waste in the river is 4 or below. The river will continue to polluted automatically. You pay or be paid emeralds to the other player.",
